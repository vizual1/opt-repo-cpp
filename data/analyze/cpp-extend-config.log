CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGTSAM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM" with any of
  the following names:

    GTSAMConfig.cmake
    gtsam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GTSAM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GTSAM_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GTSAM"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

          Welcome to the OpenShot Build System!

CMake will now check libopenshot's build dependencies and inform
you of any missing files or other issues.

  Building libopenshot (version 0.4.0)
  SO/API/ABI Version: 27

CMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:184 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenShotAudio.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OpenShotAudio", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenShotAudio"
  (requested version 0.4.0) with any of the following names:

    OpenShotAudioConfig.cmake
    openshotaudio-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenShotAudio" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenShotAudio_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenShotAudio" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstandardprojectsettings.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "standardprojectsettings", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "standardprojectsettings" with any of the following names:

    standardprojectsettingsConfig.cmake
    standardprojectsettings-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "standardprojectsettings" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "standardprojectsettings_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "standardprojectsettings" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

CMake Error at cmake/LibFindMacros.cmake:263 (message):
  REQUIRED PACKAGE NOT FOUND

  We only found some files of ShaderConductor, not all of them.  Perhaps your
  installation is incomplete or maybe we just didn't look in the right place?
  This package is REQUIRED and you need to install it or adjust CMake
  configuration in order to continue building halley.

  Relevant CMake configuration variables:

    ShaderConductor_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/tmpyx53xhbg/deps/include
    ShaderConductor_LIBRARY=<not found>

  You may use CMake GUI, cmake -D or ccmake to modify the values.  Delete
  CMakeCache.txt to discard all values and force full re-detection if
  necessary.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:263 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfoonathan_memory.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "foonathan_memory", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "foonathan_memory"

  Add the installation prefix of "foonathan_memory" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "foonathan_memory_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "foonathan_memory" provides a separate development package or

  By not providing "Findcatkin.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin" with any

  Add the installation prefix of "catkin" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set

  By not providing "FindGTSAM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has

  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM" with any of

  Add the installation prefix of "GTSAM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set

  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been

stderr:
CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0074 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:100 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findyaml-cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "yaml-cpp",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "yaml-cpp" with any
  of the following names:

    yaml-cppConfig.cmake
    yaml-cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "yaml-cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "yaml-cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "yaml-cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
